# codelabs research_app

In this code lab, I pull a package of random words and put it into a list view. Some styling is added and then the icon with state change is used to create another list of the favourite words. 

| Main screen | Choose fav words | Saved favourite words | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
